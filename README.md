- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd FinalThesis_AthleticsManager
```

2. **Start containers:**

docker compose up --build
```

This launches:

## 2. Running Migrations

If you're starting on a new environment (e.g., after `git clone`), the database will be empty.

1. Enter the backend container:

```bash
docker compose exec backend sh
```

2. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set username, email, and password.
